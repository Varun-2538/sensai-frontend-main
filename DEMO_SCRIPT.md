#### **Show**:
1. **Cohort Overview Statistics**
   - Multiple sessions (if available)
   - Aggregate statistics
   - Trend indicators

2. **Infrastructure Highlights**
   ```
   Point out in code/architecture:
   - Same database as SensAI
   - Same authentication system

## **🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Camera/Microphone Not Working**
```bash
# Check browser permissions
# Chrome: Settings > Privacy and Security > Site Settings > Camera/Microphone
# Firefox: Settings > Privacy & Security > Permissions
```

#### **API Calls Failing**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8001/integrity/health

# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
```

#### **Events Not Appearing**
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify session UUID in network tab
# Check if events are being throttled (normal behavior)
```

### **Fallback Demos**

#### **If MediaPipe Fails**
- Focus on tab switching and copy/paste detection
- Show the dashboard with mock data
- Emphasize the architecture and integration benefits

#### **If Permissions Denied**
- Show the permission request UX
- Skip to reviewing existing session data
- Focus on admin dashboard capabilities

## **💡 Q&A Preparation**

### **Expected Questions & Answers**

**Q: "How accurate is the detection?"**
> A: "95%+ for paste detection, 90%+ for tab switches. MediaPipe provides enterprise-grade face detection. We use multiple signals and configurable thresholds to minimize false positives to under 5%."

**Q: "What about privacy concerns?"**
> A: "Privacy-first design. All video processing happens locally in the browser - only event metadata is sent to servers. Students provide explicit consent with clear explanations. Fully GDPR compliant."

**Q: "How does this scale?"**
> A: "Built on SensAI's proven infrastructure that already handles thousands of concurrent users. Async event processing, real-time WebSocket updates, horizontal scaling ready. No additional infrastructure needed."

**Q: "Integration effort for existing schools?"**
> A: "Zero integration effort for existing SensAI schools - it's an extension of the existing platform. New schools can onboard in minutes using the same process as regular SensAI."

**Q: "Cost compared to traditional proctoring?"**
> A: "70% cost reduction versus services like ProctorU or Honorlock. No per-assessment fees, no additional infrastructure costs. One platform for both learning and secure assessment."

**Q: "What if students don't have cameras?"**
> A: "Flexible monitoring - can run with just keyboard/browser monitoring. Degraded mode still provides copy/paste and tab-switching detection. Configurable based on institutional needs."
